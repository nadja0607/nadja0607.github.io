                    heart-shaped country located in southeastern Europe, governed by three presidents, each being a
                    representative of another ethnicity. It’s the place where people are divided by language and
                    religion, yet all craving world-famous Cevapi meatballs and the aroma of fresh ground coffee beans.
                    The place where there is a mixture of East and West in the food you eat and the buildings you
                    observe, where a mosque, a church, and a synagogue stand right next to each other - all due to the
                    rich history involved, Ottoman Empire and Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. 6th April 1945, the liberation
                    of Sarajevo in World War II, is known as the Day of the City.</h2>

                    During the 1990s, Sarajevo could be found on the front pages of daily newspapers around the
                    whole
                    world. This city entered the longest siege since WWII in 1992 during one of the bloodiest wars
                    in
                    recent European history. During the siege, in 1995, Sarajevo Film Festival (SFF) was founded.
                    Today,
                    it is one of the most prominent and major film festivals in Europe which brings famous
                    international
                    and local people to Sarajevo in August every year. This video was made for the SFF and it can
                    truly
                    serve as a representation of how finding yourself in Sarajevo feels like.
